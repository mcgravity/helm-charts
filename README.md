# helm-charts
Some time ago i started small projects with raspberryPi 4. 
After creating kubernetes cluster noticed that some good apps lack of helm charts which would be easily installable.

This first chart pigallery2 is used for https://bpatrik.github.io/pigallery2/
so if you have raspberrypi cluster running kubernetes and have NAS or openmediavault
this can come in handy. You can install pigallery2 to kubernetes cluster and fetch images from nfs.
